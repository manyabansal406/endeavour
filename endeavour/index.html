                <h2 id="heartdiseases"> What is heart disease?</h2>
                <p>Heart disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems. It's also called cardiovascular disease, <br>which means heart and blood vessel disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, but<br>                    there are ways to prevent and manage many types of heart disease.</p>

                <h2>What are the types of heart disease?</h2>
                <p>There are many different types of heart disease. Some you may be born with, called congenital heart disease. Other types develop during your lifetime. Coronary artery disease (also called coronary heart disease) is the most common type
                    of heart disease. It happens slowly over time when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. The plaque narrows or blocks blood flow to the heart muscle and can lead to other
                    heart problems: Angina - chest pain from lack of blood flow Heart attacks - when part of the heart muscle dies from loss of blood flow Heart failure - when your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs Arrhythmia - a
                    problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat Other types of heart diseases may affect your heart valves or heart muscle (cardiomyopathy).</p>

                <h2 id="causes">What causes heart diseases?</h2>
                <p>The causes of heart disease depend on the type of disease. Some possible causes include lifestyle, genetics, infections, medicines, and other diseases.</p>

                <h2>Who is more likely to develop heart diseases?</h2>
                <p>There are many different factors that can make you more likely to develop heart disease. Some of these factors you can change, but others you cannot.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Age. Your risk of heart disease goes up as you get older.</li>
                    <li>Sex. Some factors may affect heart disease risk differently in women than in men.</li>
                    <li>Family history and genetics. A family history of early heart disease raises your risk of heart disease. And research has shown that some genes are linked to a higher risk of certain heart diseases.</li>
                    <li>Race/ethnicity. Certain groups have higher risks than others.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>habits. Over time, unhealthy lifestyle habits can raise your risk heart disease:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eating a diet high in saturated fats, refined carbohydrates, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Not getting enough physical activity.</li>
                    <li>Drinking too much alcohol.</li>
                    <li>Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke.<br></li>
                    <li>Too much stress.<br></li>
                </ul> other medical conditions can raise your risk of heart diseases. These conditions include:
                <ul>
                    <li>High blood pressure.</li>
                    <li>High cholesterol levels.</li>
                    <li>Diabetes.</li>
                    <li>Obesity.</li>
                    <li>Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.</li>
                    <li>Chronic kidney disease.</li>
                    <li>Metabolic syndrome.
                        <li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="symptoms">What are the symptoms of heart disease?</h2>
                <p>Your symptoms will depend on the type of heart disease you have. You may not have symptoms at first. In some cases, you may not know you have heart disease until you have a complication such as a heart attack.<br> The heart may beat too
                    quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include:<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chest pain or discomfort</li>
                    <li>Dizziness</li>
                    <li>Fainting (syncope) or near fainting</li>
                    <li>Fluttering in the chest</li>
                    <li>Lightheadednes</li>
                    <li>Racing heartbeat (tachycardia)</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>Slow heartbeat (bradycardia)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Heart disease symptoms caused by congenital heart defects<br> Serious congenital heart defects usually are noticed soon after birth. Congenital heart defect symptoms in children could include:<br></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Pale gray or blue skin or lips (cyanosis)</li>
                    <li>Swelling in the legs, belly area or areas around the eyes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain Less-serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually
                    aren't immediately life-threatening include:<br></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity</li>
                    <li>Easily tiring during exercise or activity<br></li>
                    <li>Swelling of the hands, ankles or feet</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Heart disease symptoms caused by diseased heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) Early stages of cardiomyopathy may not cause noticeable symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting</li>
                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                    <li>Feeling short of breath during activity or at rest</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Feeling short of breath at night when trying to sleep or waking up short of breath<br> Heart disease symptoms caused by heart valve problems (valvular heart disease) The heart has four valves â€” the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid
                    valves. They open and close to move blood through the heart. Many things can damage the heart valves. A heart valve may become narrowed (stenosis), leaky (regurgitation or insufficiency) or close improperly (prolapse).<br> Valvular
                    heart disease is also called heart valve disease. Depending on which valve isn't working properly, heart valve disease symptoms generally include:<br></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chest pain</li>
                    <li>Fainting (syncope)</li <li>Fatigue</li>
                    <li>Irregular heartbeat</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>Swollen feet or ankles</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Endocarditis is an infection that affects the heart valves and inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valves (endocardium). Endocarditis symptoms can include:<br></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Dry or persistent cough</li>
                    <li>Fever</li>
                    <li>Heartbeat changes</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>Skin rashes or unusual spots</li>
                    <li>Swelling of the legs or belly area</li>
                    <li>Weakness or fatigue</li>
                </ul>

                <p>How are heart diseases diagnosed? To find out if you have heart disease, your health care provider will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms</li>
                    <li>Ask about your family health history, including relatives who have had heart disease</li>
                    <li>Do a physical exam</li>
                    <li>Likely run heart tests and blood tests</li>
                    <li>In some cases, your provider may refer you to a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) for tests, diagnosis, and care.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="preventions">What are the treatments for heart disease?</h2>
                <p>Treatment plans for heart disease depend on the type of heart disease you have, how serious your symptoms are, and what other health conditions you have. Possible treatments may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heart-healthy lifestyle changes</li>
                    <li>Medicines</li>
                    <li>Procedures or surgeries</li>
                    <li>Cardiac rehabilitation</li>
                    <li>Can heart diseases be prevented?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You may be able to lower your risk of certain heart diseases by making heart-healthy lifestyle changes and managing any other medical conditions you have.</p>
